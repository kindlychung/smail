= smail: Send emails on the commandline, using Gmail API

This project is discontinued because zip files uploaded through its Java API are immediately corrupt.  I am working on a similar project using dropbox.

== Installation under Unix-like systems

.Compile and put the jar file somewhere.

[[app-listing]]
[source,bash]
--------
git clone https://github.com/kindlychung/smail
cd smail
sbt assembly
cp target/scala-2.11/smail-assembly-1.0.jar ~/opt/jar
--------

.Add an alias in `~/.bash_aliases` (change the path to jar file accordingly):

[[app-listing]]
[source,bash]

alias smail='java -jar ~/opt/jar/smail-assembly-1.0.jar'

.Profit!
