= sdrive: Upload files to google drive in the commandline

This project is discontinued because zip files uploaded through its Java API are immediately corrupt.  I am working on a similar project using dropbox.

== Installation under Unix-like systems

.Compile and put the jar file somewhere.

[[app-listing]]
[source,bash]
--------
git clone https://github.com/kindlychung/sdrive
cd sdrive
sbt assembly
cp target/scala-2.11/scaladrive-assembly-1.0.1.jar ~/opt/jar/
--------

.Add an alias in `~/.bash_aliases` (change the path to jar file accordingly):

[[app-listing]]
[source,bash]
--------
alias sdrive='java -jar ~/opt/jar/scaladrive-assembly-1.0.1.jar'

.Profit!
